# GUI Framework Comparison for ForGE Modernization

## Executive Summary

This document evaluates various GUI framework options for the ForGE (Fortran GUI Environment) modernization project. The goal is to select one or more backends that provide modern, cross-platform GUI capabilities with good Fortran integration.

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Fortran Integration**: Ease of creating/using Fortran bindings
- **Cross-Platform**: Linux, Windows, macOS support
- **Modern Features**: Contemporary UI patterns and widgets
- **Active Development**: Ongoing maintenance and community support
- **Learning Curve**: Ease of use for Fortran developers
- **Dependencies**: External requirements and complexity
- **Performance**: Rendering speed and responsiveness
- **License**: Compatibility with GPL v3+

## Framework Options

### 1. GTK4 (via gtk-fortran or custom bindings)

**Status**: Requires significant binding development work

**Pros**:
- Modern, feature-rich toolkit (GTK 4.x)
- Excellent cross-platform support
- Native look-and-feel on different platforms
- Strong graphics capabilities (Cairo integration)
- Active development community
- LGPL license (compatible with GPL)

**Cons**:
- gtk-fortran project primarily supports GTK2/GTK3
- No official GTK4 Fortran bindings exist yet
- Would require creating new bindings or extending gtk-fortran
- Significant API changes from GTK2 â†’ GTK4
- Large dependency footprint

**Effort Estimate**: High (3-6 months for basic bindings)

**Recommendation**: Consider for future phases after evaluating simpler options

### 2. Tcl/Tk with ftcl

**Status**: Fortran bindings available (fortran-lang/ftcl)

**Pros**:
- Existing Fortran 2018 bindings (ftcl package)
- Cross-platform (Tk 8.6)
- Lightweight and fast
- Simple event model
- Easy to prototype
- Tcl/Tk has extensive documentation
- BSD-style license

**Cons**:
- Older UI aesthetic (though improving with modern themes)
- Less "native" look than GTK/Qt
- Smaller widget set compared to modern frameworks
- Fortran bindings may need extension for advanced features

**Effort Estimate**: Low-Medium (1-2 months including learning)

**Recommendation**: **Strong candidate for initial implementation**

---

### 3. Qt6 via C++ Wrapper

**Status**: Requires creating custom C wrapper layer

**Pros**:
- Very modern, polished UI
- Excellent cross-platform support
- Rich widget set and features
- Qt Quick/QML for declarative UI
- Great documentation
- Professional applications use it

**Cons**:
- C++ framework requires wrapper layer
- Large framework and dependencies
- GPL or commercial license (compatible but complex)
- Steep learning curve
- Heavy build requirements

**Effort Estimate**: High (4-6 months for usable wrapper)

**Recommendation**: Consider for advanced features in later phases

---

### 4. Dear ImGui (Immediate-Mode GUI)

**Status**: C library with potential for Fortran bindings

**Pros**:
- Simple, immediate-mode paradigm
- Excellent for tool/debug UIs
- High performance
- Easy to integrate
- Bloat-free
- MIT license

**Cons**:
- Different paradigm (immediate vs retained mode)
- Primarily designed for game/tool UIs
- Less suitable for traditional desktop apps
- Requires graphics context (OpenGL/DirectX/Vulkan)
- Limited theming/customization

**Effort Estimate**: Medium (2-3 months)

**Recommendation**: Interesting niche option, not ideal for general GUI apps

---

### 5. Web-Based (HTML/CSS/JS Backend)

**Status**: Requires HTTP server + WebView or Electron-like approach

**Pros**:
- Extremely flexible UI design
- Leverage web technologies
- Cross-platform
- Rich ecosystem
- Familiar to many developers

**Cons**:
- Complex architecture (Fortran backend + web frontend)
- Requires HTTP server in Fortran
- WebView dependencies vary by platform
- Performance overhead
- Complex deployment

**Effort Estimate**: Very High (6+ months)

**Recommendation**: Interesting but overly complex for this project

---

### 6. Native OS APIs (Win32/Cocoa/X11)

**Status**: Direct ISO_C_BINDING to platform APIs

**Pros**:
- True native look-and-feel
- No external dependencies
- Maximum performance
- Full platform feature access

**Cons**:
- Must implement for each platform separately
- Very low-level, tedious
- Enormous development effort
- No code reuse across platforms
- Complex event handling

**Effort Estimate**: Extreme (12+ months for basic features)

**Recommendation**: Not practical for this project

---

### 7. Custom Framework (Cairo + Platform Windowing)

**Status**: Build from scratch using existing knowledge

**Approach**:
- Use Cairo for rendering (already familiar from ForGE v0.4)
- Platform-specific windowing:
  - Windows: Win32 API
  - Linux: X11 or Wayland
  - macOS: Cocoa
- Custom widget system
- Custom event handling

**Pros**:
- Complete control over API
- Leverage existing Cairo knowledge
- Lightweight
- Tailored to Fortran
- Can start simple and expand

**Cons**:
- Enormous development effort
- Must reinvent many wheels
- Platform-specific code for windowing
- Limited compared to mature frameworks
- Ongoing maintenance burden

**Effort Estimate**: Very High (8-12 months for basic features)

**Recommendation**: Interesting learning project, but impractical for production use

## Recommended Strategy

### Phase 1: Tcl/Tk Backend (Primary)

**Rationale**: 
- Existing Fortran bindings (ftcl)
- Quick to implement and demonstrate
- Cross-platform out of the box
- Good for most standard GUI needs
- Low risk, fast time-to-value

**Implementation**:
1. Use ftcl package from fortran-lang.org
2. Create ForGE API layer on top
3. Implement core widgets
4. Focus on API design that's backend-agnostic

### Phase 2: Backend Abstraction

**Rationale**:
- Design ForGE API to be backend-independent
- Allow multiple backends to coexist
- Users can choose based on their needs

**Implementation**:
1. Define abstract backend interface
2. Implement Tcl/Tk backend first
3. Architecture supports adding GTK4, Qt, or custom backends later

### Phase 3: Additional Backends (Future)

Based on user demand and resources:
- **GTK4**: If gtk-fortran adds support or we develop bindings
- **Qt**: For projects requiring more polished UI
- **ImGui**: For scientific/tool applications
- **Custom**: If specific features are needed

## Proof-of-Concept Plan

### Week 1-2: Tcl/Tk POC
- Install Tcl/Tk and ftcl
- Create simple window with button
- Test event handling
- Evaluate API ergonomics

### Week 3-4: Architecture Design
- Design backend abstraction layer
- Define core widget interfaces
- Plan event system
- Sketch API design

### Week 5-6: Minimal Implementation
- Implement Window class
- Implement 3-5 basic widgets
- Create hello world example
- Validate approach

## Dependencies

### Tcl/Tk Backend
- Tcl/Tk 8.6+ (typically pre-installed on Linux/macOS, easy install on Windows)
- ftcl (Fortran bindings) - can vendor or use as fpm dependency
- Fortran 2008+ compiler

### Build Tools
- fpm (Fortran Package Manager)
- CMake 3.20+
- Modern Fortran compiler (gfortran 9+, ifort, ifx)

## Conclusion

**Primary Recommendation**: Implement ForGE with Tcl/Tk backend first using ftcl bindings

**Rationale**:
1. Lowest risk and fastest implementation
2. Existing, tested Fortran bindings
3. Cross-platform with minimal effort
4. Allows focus on API design
5. Backend abstraction enables future alternatives

**Next Steps**:
1. Create Tcl/Tk proof-of-concept
2. Design backend-agnostic API
3. Implement core ForGE modules with Tcl/Tk backend
4. Gather user feedback
5. Evaluate additional backends based on demand
